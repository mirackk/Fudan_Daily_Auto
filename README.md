Automatically deliver fudandaily info to college

## To use this file:
1, clone to your local env

2, you have to fullfill the userid and password in the .py doc

3, personally I use my ubuntu server and crontab function to active it everyday. you can use any kind of planned method as you want, for e.g. you can pack it into a .exe and use window plan to exec it or refer to others' repository to use github workflow.
